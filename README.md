# AI GENERATED IMAGE DETECTION

## Problem Statement- 
With the advent of generative AI, it has become easily difficult to separate real data from AI-Generated.
The goal is to develop a model that can identify a fake photo created by AI

## Solution -
Building a predictive model that embibes the knowledge of AI-Generated images, and uses them to predict the label of a random image at test time

## Results
* Accuracy of model obtained is 0.85



## Tools used: 
- Python 3
- Tensorflow 
- Jupyter
